        Here's the thing. You said a "pupper is a doggo. Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers
        doggos. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "doggo family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos
        to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind). So your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people "call the small yip yip ones doggos?" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human
        or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling
        all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
